## 😎 My Contributions to Open Source

I created a simple tool to make copying the current directory easier, called `cppwd`. If this can help you, feel free to access npm and install it.

Link to access: [cppwd on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cppwd)

What truly ignites my passion is rejuvenating older projects, breathing new life into them, and making them look fresh and contemporary 😎. Whether it's implementing best coding practices or enhancing security measures, I relish the challenge of development.
