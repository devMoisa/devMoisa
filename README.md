# 👋 Wassupp!

I'm **Moisés Vilas Boas**, a **Senior Fullstack Engineer**, working with programming since **2017**.  
Feel free to talk with me about:  
**Node.js**, **React**, **React Native**, **Next.js**, **AWS**, **Git**, **Go**, and **VIM/NeoVim**.

## 😎 My Contributions to Open Source

I created a simple tool to make copying the current directory easier, called **`cppwd`**.  
If this tool can help you, feel free to install it directly from npm.

👉 **[cppwd on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cppwd)**
